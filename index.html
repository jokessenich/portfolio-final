            <p>I am a lifelong learner and explorer, led by curiosity and the desire to affect positive change.
                I enjoy coding because understanding the mechanisms behind the world that I interact with fascinates me.
                Building code from the ground up is an immensely challenging and exciting task with a humbling sense of
                accomplishment.
                <br><br>
                In play time, I love to have adventures and find joy in the natural world around me.
                You can find me coated in sand from playing beach volleyball, living off the grid in a cabin that was
                built with friends,
                traveling to a new place that my heart has called me to, or making a cup of tea for my loving partner.

                        Math Department as a way to determine a student's projected grade. It was built
                        with raw HTML/JS as requested by the professor to be easily copy pasted onto his editing
                        platform.
                        The website has been used by over 500 students
